        "設想一個應用情境，並使用 Fooocus 生成圖像\n",
        "\n",
        "## 應用情境\n",
        "**個人品牌圖像**：打造一系列統一風格的插畫人物頭像，用於 Instagram、LinkedIn 和個人網站，提高品牌辨識度。\n",
        "\n",
        "## 創作流程\n",
        "1. **靈感來源**：希望呈現出一個「科技感 + 專業但親切」的風格，靈感來自 Notion、Raycast、Figma 等工具的官網風格，以及 Midjourney 常見的人像構圖。\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **設定與嘗試**：\n",
        "\n",
        "- 初步設定 prompt：使用自然語言描述想像中的人物與背景。\n",
        "\n",
        "- 風格套用：測試不同風格模型（如插畫風、數位肖像、極簡 UI 插圖）。\n",
        "\n",
        "- 使用 Inpaint 修補小細節：修正臉部瑕疵、背景中不自然的元素。\n",
        "\n",
        "- 使用 Canny 加強輪廓控制：確保人物的輪廓清晰、符合個人品牌框架。\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **輸出與優化**：匯出 2~3 組備選圖像。比較主題一致性與辨識度。加入 logo、水印與統一邊框風格後使用於社群平台。\n",

        "\n",
        "## 使用心得分享\n",
        "Fooocus 的流程相當直觀，尤其在試圖控制構圖或角色細節時，Inpaint 與 Canny 的組合非常實用。\n",
        "\n",
        "相較 Midjourney，Fooocus 更適合需要針對小細節微調的任務。\n",
        "\n",
        "搭配 UI 模板與品牌識別元件後，可以快速生成一整套符合品牌視覺的圖像。\n",
        "\n",
        "建議一次輸出多張圖片，從中挑選最具一致性的一組，有助於後續的品牌視覺延伸。"
